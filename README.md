# Coding Demonstrations: Programming for Social Science Research

Computational methods for collecting, cleaning and analysing data are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit. Central to engaging in these methods is the ability to write readable and effective code using a programming language.

## Topics

The following topics are covered under this training series:
1. **Introduction to Python for social scientists** - Learn how to utilise the Python programming language for core social science research tasks.

2. **Setting up your computational environment** -  Learn how to create, manage and share a Python computational environment.

## Materials

The training materials - including recordings, slides, and sample Python code - can be found in the following folders:
* [code](./code) - run and/or download the code examples using our Jupyter notebook resources.
* [installation](./installation) - view instructions for how to download and install Python and other packages necessary for working with new forms of data.
* [webinars](./webinars) - watch recordings of the coding demonstrations on our Youtube channel.

## Acknowledgements

We are grateful to UKRI through the Economic and Social Research Council for their generous funding of this training series.
