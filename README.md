# Coding Demonstrations: Programming for Social Science Research

Computational methods for collecting, cleaning and analysing data are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit. Central to engaging in these methods is the ability to write readable and effective code using a programming language.

## Topics

The following topics are covered under this training series:
1. **Becoming a Computational Social Scientist** -  Learn how to enhance your existing social science skills with key computational skills to step out into computational social science.

2. **Introduction to Python for social scientists** - Learn how to utilise the Python programming language for core social science research tasks.

3. **Setting up your computational environment** -  Learn how to create, manage and share a Python computational environment.

## Materials

Start by launching the Binder virtual environment in your browser by clicking this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/computational-social-science/HEAD). 

The training materials for each of the of the topics listed above can be found in- including recordings, slides, and sample Python code - can be found in the following folders:
* [code](./code) - run and/or download the code examples using our Jupyter notebook resources. These are the files that end in .pynb. Clicking on these files will open a new browser window with the code notebook running in a virtual environment! These virtual environments are temporary - your changes will not be saved and the environment will shut down if you remain inactive in that browser window too long. But you can always open it again.  
* [webinars](./webinars) - watch recordings of the coding demonstrations on our Youtube channel.
