    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open-source, general purpose, high level and extensible programming language. These terms may be unfamiliar, especially in this context, so let's take them one-by-one:\n",
    "* **Open source** - the source code that underpins Python is freely available for others to use, modify and share, as long as these activities comply with the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/license.html\" target=_blank>license</a>. Watch this neat <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8\" target=_blank>overview</a> of open-source software to learn more.\n",
    "* **General purpose** - Python can be used for a multitude of programming activities, such as web development, scientific computing, software development, system administration, and more.\n",
    "* **High level** - the way Python is written is highly abstracted from the language your machine uses to send, receive and store information. Computers receive instructions in a language called *binary*, which is a series of 1s and 0s that represent a range of characters. For example, here is my name (\"Diarmuid\") represented as binary: <br><br>01000100 01101001 01100001 01110010 01101101 01110101 01101001 01100100<br><br>The first sequence of 8 bits (known as a \"byte\") represents the letter \"D\", the second sequence the letter \"i\" and so on. It would be difficult and tedious in the extreme to write programming code in sequences of binary, hence the creation of high-level languages that are easier to read, write and understand by humans.\n",
    "* **Extensible** - Python's functionality, capabilities and range of uses can be expanded. This is often achieved through the creation and sharing of additional, open-source add-ons (known as *packages*). For example, the `BeautifulSoup` module was created to enable Python users to extract information from web pages. "

Python does come with some methods and functions that are ready to use straight away, but for computational social science tasks you'll almost certainly need to import some additional modules.\n",

    "* **How to read and manipulate data in files** Plenty of software packages (e.g., Stata, SPSS) and programming languages (e.g., R) provide functionality for working with data. Python is no different, and we consider it to have considerable advantages over other tools.\n",

    "Python is a very powerful programming language, brimful of methods - data manipulation, web-scraping, natural langauge processing, interactive data visualisations - that are of great use to social scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jane's research task, creating a sampling frame, could have been solved using a manual approach: creating folders using `right-click > New folder`, opening each file individually and copy-and-pasting rows into a new file etc. While we do not advocate using Python for every task or project, we encourage you to think clearly about the advantages of adopting a computational approach:\n",
    "* **Scalability** - What happens if there are 10, 100, or 1000 files instead of 3?\n",
    "* **Accuracy** - What if Jane makes a mistake when copy-and-pasting records from the individual files? How will she know she's made a mistake?\n",
    "* **Reproducibility** - What if Jane loses the sampling frame file? What if Jane wants to collaborate with another researcher? Does that person need to manually create the same folders, recreate or update the sampling frame?\n",
    "* **Automatability** - What if new data becomes available on a monthly basis? Does Jane need to set a reminder in her calendar to download the latest data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like learning a spoke language, your initial attempts at writing code are rudimentary and frustrating. You'll find yourself only to able to write the same simple commands, wondering when Python's conventions will become second nature. However, with practice and immersion (through a relevant project) you will find your ability increases rapidly. In our assessment, the learning curve for social scientists developing their programming skills is steep at the beginning (\"What the hell is a loop!?\"), gentle in the middle (\"Huh, so that's how you scrape a website\"), and steep once again at the end (\"Why did God invent neural networks...\").\n",
