# Interactive coding materials

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output.

If you would like to run and/or edit the code without installing any software on your machine, click on the Binder button at the top-level of this github repository. (*Don't worry if takes up to a minute to launch*)

That will launch a **Binder** service allowing you to interact with the code through your web browser - as it is temporary, you will lose your work when you log out and you will be booted out if you donâ€™t do anything for a long time.

Once Binder has been launched, click through the folders to the Jupyter Notebook that you want to run (these will be the files that end in .pynb). These will open new browser tabs that you can interact with (type into, rewrite code, etc.) and run code blocks. 

Nothing you can do will break the code in any permanent way... If you get stuck or think you have made changes that you want to undo, just close the tab down and open it again from the launched Binder. You may need to shut down the whole Binder and relaunch it from the top-level github repository if you let it stand inactive too long. 

Alternatively, you can download the notebook files and run them on your own machine. See our guidance on installing Python and Jupyter [here](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/CSS-overview/blob/master/installation.md).
