In fact, we would go as far to say that computational methods are particularly valuable to social scientists from a data collection and processing perspective, and you can achieve much without ever engaging in \"big data analytics\" (e.g., machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing)."

These limits ensure the API can offer a reliable service to a wide user base (in contrast to a single user constantly requesting data and preventing others from doing so). Therefore you need to plan and structure your requests in such a way that you comply with the limit **and** retrieve the data you need for your analysis.\n",
    "* Some APIs provide accurate, detailed guides on how to make requests and handle responses; others are sparsely written and it can be a pain figuring out what data are available at each endpoint, how to correctly specify the web address, what the rate limit is etc. And if guidance is available, it might not be for the programming language you are using.\n",

    "* It can be a lot of work maintaining your code, especially if you make it available for use by others.\n",
