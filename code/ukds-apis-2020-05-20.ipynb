    "\n",
    "In essence: an API acts as an intermediary between software applications. Think of an API's role as similar to that of a translator faciliating a conversation between two individuals who do not speak the same language. Neither individual needs to know the other's language, just how to formulate their response in a way the translator can understand. Similarly, an API **simplifies** how applications communicate with each other."

    "It performs this role by providing a set of protocols/standards for making *requests* and formulating *responses* between applications. For example, a smart phone application might need real-time traffic data from an online database. An API can validate the application's request for data, and handle the online database's response (i.e., the transfer of data to the application). In the absence of an API, the smart phone application would need to know a lot more technical information about the online database in order to communicate with it (e.g., what commands does the database understand?). But thanks to the API, the smart phone application only needs to know how to formulate a request that the API understands, which then communicates the request to the database and handles the response.\n",

    "### Why would you want to use an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many public, private and charitable institutions collect and share data of value to social scientists. Often they deposit their data to a data portal - e.g., <a href=\"https://data.gov.uk/\" target=_blank>UK Government Open Data</a> -, allowing you to download the files as and when needed. However, another approach they can adopt is to allow access to the underlying information that is stored in their database through an API. Using this method, individuals can send a customised *request* for information to the database; if the request is valid, the database *responds* by providing you with the information you asked for. Think of using an API as the difference between downloading a raw data file which then needs to be filtered to arrive at the information you need, and performing the filtering when you request the data, so only what you need is returned (the API method)."

    "### What is the general approach for accessing data through an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by identifying an online database containing information of interest. Then we need to **know** the following:\n",
    "1. The location of the API (i.e., web address) through which the database can be accessed. For example, the UK Police API can be accessed via <a href=\"https://data.police.uk/api\" target=_blank>https://data.police.uk/api</a>.\n",
    "2. The terms of use associated with the API. Many APIs restrict the number of requests you can make over a given time period, while others require registration in order to authenticate who is trying to access the data. For example, the UK Police API does not require you to provide authentication but restricts the number of requests for data you can make (15 per second) - the number of allowable requests is known as the *rate limit*.\n",
    "3. The location of the data of interest on the API. For example, data on street-level crime from the UK Police API is available at: <a href=\"https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street\" target=_blank>https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street</a>. The location of the data is known as its *endpoint*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can usually find all of the information we need by reading the API's documentation e.g., <a href=\"https://data.police.uk/docs/\" target=_blank>https://data.police.uk/docs/</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to **do** the following:\n",
    "4. Register your use of the API (if required).\n",
    "5. Request data from the endpoint of interest, supplying authentication if required. This process is known as *making a call* to the API.\n",
    "6. Write this data to a file for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any programming task, it is useful to write out the steps needed to solve the problem: we call this *pseudo-code*, as it is captures the main tasks and the order in which they need to be executed."

    "\n",
    "Interacting with an API is a simple yet powerful computational method for collecting data of value for social science research. It provides a relatively gentle introduction to using programming languages, also. However, \"with great power comes great responsibility\" (sorry). APIs take you into the realm of data protection, Terms of Service/Use, and many murky ethical issues. Wielded sensibly and sensitively, collecting data from APIs is a valuable and exciting social science research method.\n",
