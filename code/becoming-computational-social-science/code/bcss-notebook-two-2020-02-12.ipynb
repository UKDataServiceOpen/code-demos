    "\n",
    "Human thinking co-evolved with human problems. Specifically, human thinking co-evolved with the kind of human problems were persistent, frequent or important enough throughout their evolutionary history to drive adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic problems \n",
    "By basic problems, we mean REALLY basic problems that apply to pretty much all living things, such as 'staying alive':\n",
    " - Responding to stimulus, including dangers that are both fast (like tigers) and slow (like the approach of winter) as well as useful things (like resources). \n",
    " - Learning in order to turn the unknown into the known so it can be responeded to appropriately (as dangerous, useful, etc.).\n",
    " - Recognising patterns so as to respond more quickly to known patterns as stimulus or to pique curiosity and drive learning around new patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### More advanced problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans also have more advanced problems that apply to fewer kinds of living things. Most notably, these only apply to social living things. In essence, a big problem for humans is 'other people':\n",
    " - Understanding the intentions, or likely intentions, of the people around us. \n",
    " - Predicting likely next actions or responses. \n",
    " - The role of intentions, actions and responses within wider patterns like collaboration, competition or some combination of them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these problems involve a kind of thinking that doesn’t exactly look like \"thinking\". \n",
    " - People often respond to perceived dangers even before they were consciously aware of the danger. \n",
    " - People don't have to put a whole lot of mental effort into learning things like \"Avoid the snarling animal\" or \"Don't eat the bitter tasting fruit\". \n",
    " - People don’t really sit down and deliberately set out to compare the footsteps heard on the stairs against the known footsteps of the housemate or not. \n",
    " - People can recognise other people, read their faces, judge a situation and react all before they can consciously think about it.\n",
    " \n",
    " Most of these examples of common human thinking are nearly always invisible. These are not examples of **irrational** thinking so much as **sub-rational** thinking that operates at instinctual levels, much faster than those that underpin rational thinking."

    "\n",
    "Computers do not have computer problems, at least not in the sense that humans have human problems. Without intervention, a computer does not try to stay alive, to communicate, to learn about its surroundings... Basically, computers just do computer thinking about human problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "And humans have tried to give computers ALL KINDS of human problems. Not all of that has worked equally well, because computers do not have the kind of co-evolutionary drive linked to human problems that humans have had. Nevertheless, they are very good at dealing with some problems, especially those that humans are **not good at**. For example, problems that:\n",

    "\n",
    "Human thinking is typically needed to identify the problem, possible solutions, relevant info, etc. This is especially true of problems that deal with humans and human behaviour. For example, trying to predict how people will react to an innovation, a policy change, a new trend, etc. requires understanding and predicting how people will interpret new information, how they will apply that information to their diverse personal goals and fears, how they will choose to react (hopefully) in line with existing laws and societal norms, etc. At the same time, computer thinking is needed if dealing with that problem involves working accurately and reproducibly with large volumes of (complex) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a new law is proposed that makes smart meters obligatory for all new houses. Social science researchers could think about how people might react to this new law - they might create some abstract scenarios, identify potential problems, identify similar new laws in the past and try to categorise human reactions to those laws, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if those social scientists want to know how people *actually* do react to this new law, then they will need to collect quite a lot of potentially very complex data, ideally from different sources (interviews, smart meter data, social media discussions, freedom of information requests, etc.). Those social scientists will need to employ computer thinking to integrate all of that vast and complex data in useful ways that might actually address the problem. \n",

    "* **Decomposition** - Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "* **Pattern Recognition** - Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data.\n",
    "* **Abstraction** - Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns.\n",
    "* **Algorithm Design** - Developing the step by step instructions for solving this and similar problems.\n",
