    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Social Science: it can be a scary, alluring, mystifying term. You may even be thinking, what's the big deal? Surely almost all social science involves the use of computers: we code our interviews using software such as NVivo; build our statistical models in SPSS, Stata etc; and generally conduct our research and teaching activities within a computational environment (e.g., personal desktop/laptop, Dropbox or iCloud for file storage). However, computational social science (CSS) refers to activities and technologies that go beyond what we're typically familiar with as social scientists:\n",
    "* The use of datasets that are too large to store on your personal machine; \n",
    "* Writing programming scripts to access information held in online databases; \n",
    "* Employing analytical techniques, derived from computer science, that reveal structures and patterns in large or unfamiliar datasets (e.g. network analysis, text mining). \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, computational social science is an interdisciplinary branch of research, defined more by its methods and data than its substantive topics (Heiberger & Riebling, 2016). It is not limited to certain analytical approaches (e.g., Machine Learning) or data types (e.g., just text data). So what makes computational social science different from \"traditional\" social science? What types of knowledge and skills do you need to engage in computational methods? And why would you want to be a computational social scientist?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will describe and demonstrate five key domains of computational social science:\n",
    "1. Thinking computationally\n",
    "2. Writing code\n",
    "3. Computational environments\n",
    "4. Manipulating structured and unstructured data\n",
    "5. Reproducibility of the scientific workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover key theories and ideas behind each domain and provide example code, written in the popular Python programming language, that demonstrates some of the key skills computational social scientists need to develop."

    "### Computational social science is an opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational social science means working with new forms of digital data and analytical methods to address new problems or to address existing problems in new ways. Both of these mean that computational social science opens up a whole new galaxy of potential research opportunities! That's a rather grand statement but it's true: vast swathes of our daily lives, social interactions, activities and other behaviours are captured digitally. These are often aggregated into large and rich data sets, many of which are **only** available if you possess the right programming skills to access and manage data from websites, documents, records, images, corpora and algorithms (Kitchin, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Halford and Savage (2017) outline further advantages to engaging in computational social science, especially from a data perspective:\n",
    "* Utilise techniques for handling and analysing large-scale, unstructured data. \n",
    "* Capture data that is generated in real time and over time.\n",
    "* Access information on new/previously unmeasured activities.\n",
    "* Access information on familiar/currently measured activities at an unprecedented scale, dynamism or complexity.\n",
    "* It's happening whether we (social scientists) like it or not (see also Heiberger & Riebling, 2016); empirical social science in general is having its moment in the sun, in much the same way the social theorists did in the recent past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social science research is increasingly interdisciplinary, and knowledge of and experience with computational methods gives you an advantage in terms of securing future research funding, academic positions, working as part of an interdisciplinary team and more (Brooker, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, but certainly not least, there's more to computational social science than boosting your research standing or productivity. We rather like Sociologist Dr James Allen-Robertson's reflections on this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In response to the question of what computational social science has helped me achieve, it may seem obvious to mention the concrete projects, the outputs, the measurable outcomes. However, for me computational social science has achieved something more substantial and enduring — a new way of working, a new way of thinking, and a new kind of enthusiasm for research.<sup>[1]</sup>\n",

    "\n",
    "There are limitations associated with computational social science of course; ethical consent is still needed to access and use these new forms of data; depending on the data set in question, it may not be possible to use your personal or work machine due to a lack of computational resources and capacity (e.g., not enough hard drive space, memory); and data quality issues are no trivial matter in large, unstructured data sets (see Halford and Savage, 2017 for a deeper discussion)."

These skills may not be easy to obtain as they require a mode of thinking and intellectual dexterity that you may not have practiced before. However, a little ability goes a long way. You do not need to be a software engineer to successfully scrape a website and you do not need to have a high-performance computing environment or server to manipulate data accessed through Spotify or Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brooker (2020) calls this approach the \"grilled cheese\" methodology for programming: your computational activities really just need to be effective i.e., produce the results you need or expect. Elegance, concision and optimisation (e.g., shaving milliseconds off the running time of your code) can come later - or not at all - as a computational social scientist. In the short-term at least, the aim is not to learn everything about a particular technique, but enough to achieve your research aim e.g., write an executable programming script for collecting data from Wikipedia. Dr James Allen-Robertson is once again quite insightful on this point:\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to be a computational social scientist?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are myriad aspects to the role, being a computational social scientist typically involves one or more of the following practices:\n",
    "* Writing programming scripts to collect and manipulate data.\n",
    "* Employing analytical techniques - many derived from computer/information sciences - to reveal patterns in data.\n",
    "* Using technological tools and e-Research best practice to structure and document your research workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is, as a trained social scientist, you do not need to learn all of these aspects from scratch and can instead apply the knowledge, skills and strengths that you have already! For example, social scientists possess knowledge - theoretical and empirical - of social systems and phenomena and already have advanced data skills, especially around:\n",
    " - categorising and coding responses (qualitative and/or quantitative), \n",
    " - evaluating data quality (e.g., why is this survey response missing?), and \n",
    " - making inferences from data (e.g., how representative is this pattern of a larger population?). \n",
    " \n",
    "Thus, the main gaps in your skillset concern one or more of the following:\n",
    " - awareness of computational environments and processes, \n",
    " - experience with or knowledge of computational and/or data resources, \n",
    " - programming skills and knowledge of programming languages,\n",
    " - experience with or knowledge of how to document work to improve reproducibility, and \n",
    " - communicating the results of computational social science analyses. \n",
