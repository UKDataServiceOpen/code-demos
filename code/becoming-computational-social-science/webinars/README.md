## 1. Being a Computational Social Scientist
Tthis webinar demystifies computational social science, and explores how and why social scientists should embrace computational methods. Presented by Dr Julia Kasmire and Dr Diarmuid McDonnell of the UK Data Service, this webinar examines five key domains of computational social science: 
1. Thinking computationally
2. Writing code
3. Computational environments
4. Manipulating structured and unstructured data
5. Reproducibility of the scientific workflow
We cover key theories and ideas behind each domain and provide example code, written in the popular Python programming language, that demonstrates some of the key skills computational social scientists need to develop.
