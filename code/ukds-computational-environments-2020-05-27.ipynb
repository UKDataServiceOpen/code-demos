In the absence of an API, the smart phone application would need to know a lot more technical information about the online database in order to communicate with it (e.g., what commands does the database understand?).

    "* **How to import modules**. You will usually need to import modules into Python to support your work. Python does come with some methods and functions that are ready to use straight away, but for computational social science tasks you'll almost certainly need to import some additional modules.\n",
    "* **How to make requests (calls) for data to an API**. You can use Python to request data from an API.\n",
    "* **How to handle and save the data that is returned by the API**. APIs tend to return data in JSON format, which requires different data manipulation techniques than you may be used to. You can process this data and save it to a file for future use.\n",
    "* **How to do all of the above in an efficient, clear and effective manner**."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting with an API is a simple yet powerful computational method for collecting data of value for social science research. It provides a relatively gentle introduction to using programming languages, also. However, \"with great power comes great responsibility\" (sorry). APIs take you into the realm of data protection, Terms of Service/Use, and many murky ethical issues. Wielded sensibly and sensitively, collecting data from APIs is a valuable and exciting social science research method.\n",
