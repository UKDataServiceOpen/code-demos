    "In the digital era, computation is becoming central to research and analytical work. Researchers and analysts are increasingly dependent on specialised hardware, software, data and other technological tools to produce their results. In conjunction, there are valid concerns around the reproducibility of scientific work (Christensen et al., 2019; Wynants et al., 2020). Therefore it is critical that attempts are made to ensure a piece of research or analytical work can be reproduced by others. One solution to this problem is to capture and make available the computational environment (or the core aspects of it) in which the work was undertaken.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interacting with an API is a simple yet powerful computational method for collecting data of value for social science research. It provides a relatively gentle introduction to using programming languages, also. However, \"with great power comes great responsibility\" (sorry). APIs take you into the realm of data protection, Terms of Service/Use, and many murky ethical issues. Wielded sensibly and sensitively, collecting data from APIs is a valuable and exciting social science research method.\n",
